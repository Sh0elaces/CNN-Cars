# Used Car Image Classification

This project is focused on building a CNN in order to predict images of used cars from used car websites. 

The purpose of this project was to gain experience working with CNNs by experimenting with preprocessing image datasets, CNN model architectures, and different optimization techniques. 

CNN_Cars.ipynb contains python code for the project, and CNN_Cars.pdf is the paper going into finer details of the project.
